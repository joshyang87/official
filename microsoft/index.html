		<h2>Lucrative New Oil Extraction Method Involves Drilling Directly Into Gas Stations</h2>
			<hr size="1">
		
			<p><strong>IRVING, TX:</strong> Hailing it as a rapidly replenishable and easily accessible fuel source, ExxonMobil revealed a lucrative new oil extraction method Friday that involves drilling directly into gas stations. “We’ve found nearly unlimited reserves of highly refined petroleum mere meters beneath thousands of service stations across the country,” said ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, noting that the company had already erected oil extraction rigs alongside pump islands in all 50 states. <em>“As I speak, we’re yielding 3 million barrels per day just by boring through a few thin layers of asphalt, concrete, and metal. And, amazingly enough, the supply seems to somehow refill itself every week.”</em> Tillerson went on to say that the company was exploring the possibility that there were still massive untapped sources of oil already in Americans’ cars, as well as in their homes.</p>

		<h2>Scientists Speculate Extraterrestrials May Have Completely Different Hair Than Humans</h2>
			<hr size="1">
		

		<h3>Scientists say alien civilizations could potentially favor updos completely unfathomable to the human mind.</h3>
			<hr size="1">
			<p><strong>PALO ALTO, CA—Citing</strong> the near infinite number of celestial bodies in the known universe, an international panel of scientists at Stanford University released a report this week speculating that any extraterrestrials that exist may have hair entirely different from that of humans.</p>

			<p>The researchers, who analyzed data on the vast variety of atmospheric and chemical conditions found on distant worlds, suggested aliens could have hair with color and texture so different from that of human beings as to be virtually unrecognizable.</p>

			<p>“When you consider just how massive the universe is and just how many ways life could have evolved, it’s likely extraterrestrials have hair we simply don’t have the vocabulary to describe,” said astrobiologist Jeremy Rosenwald, adding that a range of factors, such as the amount of gravity or water on a planet, could influence our very definition of silky, kinky, or wavy. “After all, alien hair could be an adaptation to literally any imaginable environment. If we encountered an alien tomorrow, who knows what hair we’d be dealing with?”</p>

			<p><em>“Think of it,”</em> Rosenwald continued. <em>“Styling beyond the human brain’s capacity to even conceive.”</em></p>

			<p>Researchers used computer simulations to predict how hair might develop in a variety of extreme planetary conditions, including severe cold, sustained wind speeds in excess of 2,000 miles per hour, or the absence of an atmosphere altogether. Among their findings was reportedly the startling revelation that alien life forms might not only have brown, black, blond, or red hair, but hair whose natural color falls literally anywhere along the visual spectrum—or that is completely translucent.</p>

<h1>Harnessing Flexbox For Today’s Web Apps</h1>
<p>By <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/karenmenezes/">Karen Menezes</a></p>

<p>Although the syntax might be initially confounding, <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes">flexbox</a> lives up to its name. It creates intelligent boxes that are stretchable, squeezable and capable of changing visual order. It provides simple solutions to layout paradigms that CSS has always struggled with: vertical centering and equal heights. Flex items are truly accommodating and a pleasure to work with.</p>
<p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox">Chris Coyier sums up flexbox</a> nicely</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).</p>
<p>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flexbox truly shines with HTML5 web applications. Most web apps consist of a series of modular, reusable components. You can use flexbox for those bits of layout that induce headaches and that depend on brittle CSS hacks to work. Small modules work very well with flexbox, and you can use floats and other tools for broader sections of the layout.</p>
<p>I’m using flexbox in a big way for a web app that I’m currently working on, and I am very pleased with how it handles layout and box calculations intelligently. I’d like to share some demos and examples of this — any feedback would be appreciated.</p>
<p>This article presumes that you have working knowledge of flexbox. A wealth of information is available online. Keep in mind that the specification has undergone several changes over the years.
There are three versions of flexbox, largely differentiated by the syntax changes between 2009 and 2012:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>new</strong> syntax is in sync with the current specification (e.g. display: flex).</li>
<li>The <strong>tweener</strong> syntax is an unofficial syntax from 2012, adopted only by IE 10 (e.g. display: -ms-flexbox).</li>
<li>The <strong>old</strong> syntax is from 2009 (e.g. display: box).</li>
</ol>
<h1>Browser Support</h1>
<p>Let’s look in detail at which browsers support which syntax, <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox">courtesy of Can I Use.</a></p>
<h3>BROWSERS THAT SUPPORT THE NEW SYNTAX</h3>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unprefixed: Chrome 29+, Firefox 28+, IE 11+, Opera 17+</li>
<li>Prefixed: -webkit- prefix for Chrome 21+, Safari 6.1+, Opera 15+</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Old versions of Firefox (22 to 27) support the new syntax minus the flex-wrap and flex-flow properties. Opera (12.1+ and 17+) supports flexbox without vendor prefixes, but intermediate versions 15 and 16 require vendor prefixes.</p>
<p><strong>Touch:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unprefixed: Android 4.4+, Opera mobile 12.1+, BlackBerry 10+, Chrome for Android 39+, Firefox for Android 33+, IE 11+ mobile</li>
<li>Prefixed: -webkit- prefix for iOS 7.1+</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of the browsers mentioned above have old versions that support a prior variant of flexbox, minus some properties such as flex-wrap and flex-flow (the latter of which is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties). By avoiding flex-wrap (and, therefore, using flexbox in multi-line layouts), we get amazing browser support, merging the old and current syntax.</p>
